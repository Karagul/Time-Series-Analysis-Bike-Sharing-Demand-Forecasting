# Time-Series-Analysis---Data-Science-Competition

These are codes and report of two of my projects on Time Series Analysis.
These were team projects. So, these codes are a collaborative effort of 3
This combines traditional forecasting models like Simple Moving Average, Exponential Smoothing, Holt-Winter with ARIMA and 
also Machine Learning models using Prophet and RNN-LSTM
We also built dashboards in Tableau and Excel to choose the best model, and for future predictions
